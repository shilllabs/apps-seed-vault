Privacy Policy for Seed Packet Scanner

  Last updated: February 2025

  Seed Packet Scanner ("the App") is developed by Shillapps. This privacy policy explains how the App handles your information.

  Camera Permission: The App requests access to your device's camera solely to capture images of seed packets for text recognition and data
  extraction. Images are stored locally on your device and are not uploaded to our servers.

  Local Data Storage: All seed packet data you save (including images, extracted text, and any edits you make) is stored locally on your device.
  This data remains under your control and can be deleted at any time by removing individual entries or uninstalling the App.

  AI Processing (Optional): If you choose to enable AI-powered text extraction in Settings, the text recognized from your seed packet images is sent
   to Anthropic's Claude API for processing. This text data is used solely to extract seed packet information and is subject to Anthropic's privacy
  policy. No images are sent to external servers—only the extracted text. This feature is optional and requires you to provide your own API key.

  Data Collection: We do not collect, store, or share any personal information. The App does not require account creation, does not use analytics
  services, and does not contain advertising.
